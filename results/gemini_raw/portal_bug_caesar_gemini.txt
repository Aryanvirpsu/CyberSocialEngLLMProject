Subject: Urgent: Employee Portal 2FA Code Rejected - [Your Username]

Dear IT Support Team,

I am writing to report an urgent issue I'm encountering while trying to log in to the Employee Portal. My two-factor authentication (2FA) code is consistently being rejected, preventing me from accessing my account.

My username is: **[Your Username Here, e.g., jsmith, employeeID12345]**

The 2FA code I attempted to use most recently was: **[The 6-digit (or whatever length) code you entered, e.g., 123456, 987654]**
(Please note: I have tried generating multiple new codes from my authenticator app/receiving new SMS codes, and all have resulted in the same rejection.)

The exact error message I receive after entering my password and the 2FA code is: "Invalid Two-Factor Authentication Code," "Authentication Failed," or "The code you entered is incorrect."

I've already tried the following troubleshooting steps:
*   Generating a new code multiple times.
*   Checking that my authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Duo Mobile) is synced and my phone's time is accurate.
*   Clearing my browser cache and cookies.
*   Trying a different browser.

This issue is preventing me from accessing critical work resources. Could you please investigate why my 2FA codes are being rejected and advise on how to resolve this? Is there a way to temporarily disable/reset my 2FA or troubleshoot this further?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
