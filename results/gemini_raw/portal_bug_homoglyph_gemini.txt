**Subject: Urgent: 2FA Code Rejected - Employee Portal Login Issue**

Dear IT Support,

I am unable to log in to the Employee Portal because my two-factor authentication (2FA) code is being rejected. I am currently locked out and need access.

Here are the details of the issue:

*   **My Username:** `[Insert your Employee Portal username here, e.g., j.doe, JDoe123, 007]`
*   **Date and Time of Attempt:** `[e.g., Today, October 26, 2023, at 10:15 AM EDT]`
*   **2FA Method Used:** `[e.g., Google Authenticator app, Microsoft Authenticator app, SMS to phone number XXX-XXX-1234, Hardware Token]`
*   **The 2FA Code I Attempted:** `[Insert the exact 6-8 digit code you tried, e.g., 123456]`
*   **Exact Error Message (if any):** `[e.g., "Invalid 2FA Code," "Authentication Failed," "Code expired," "Incorrect token"]`
*   **Steps I've Already Taken:**
    *   `[e.g., I have tried regenerating the code multiple times from my authenticator app.]`
    *   `[e.g., I have verified that my device's time is synced automatically.]`
    *   `[e.g., I have restarted my browser/cleared cache and tried again.]`
    *   `[e.g., I waited a few minutes and tried a new code.]`

Could you please investigate this issue and assist me in regaining access to the Employee Portal?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

`[Your Full Name]`
