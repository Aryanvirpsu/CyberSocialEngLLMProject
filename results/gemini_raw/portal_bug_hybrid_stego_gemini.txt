Here's a sample message an employee might send to IT support when their two-factor authentication (2FA) code is rejected by the employee portal:

**Subject: Urgent: 2FA Code Rejected - Employee Portal Login Issue**

Dear IT Support Team,

I am experiencing an issue logging into the employee portal. My two-factor authentication (2FA) code is consistently being rejected, preventing me from accessing my account.

*   **My Username:** **[Your Username Here, e.g., jsmith, elenajones]**
*   **The 2FA code I attempted to use was:** **[The 6-digit code, e.g., 123456, 987654]**
*   **Time of Attempt:** Approximately [Time, e.g., 10:15 AM PST] on [Date, e.g., October 26, 2023]
*   **2FA Method:** I am using [Authenticator App Name, e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Duo Mobile / SMS message / Hardware Token] on my [Phone Model / Device].
*   **Error Message Displayed (if any):** [e.g., "Invalid code. Please try again.", "Two-Factor Authentication Failed."]

I have already tried:
1.  Generating a new code from my authenticator app/device and re-entering it.
2.  Checking that my device's time is synced correctly.
3.  Attempting to log in multiple times (approx. 2-3 times).

I need to access the portal urgently to [briefly state reason, e.g., submit my timesheet, approve expenses, access HR documents].

Could you please investigate this issue and assist me with logging in?

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]
[Your Employee ID, if applicable]
[Your Department]
