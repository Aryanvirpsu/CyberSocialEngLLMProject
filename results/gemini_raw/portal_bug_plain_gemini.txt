**Sample Message 1 (Concise & Direct)**

**Subject:** Employee Portal Login Issue - 2FA Code Rejected

Hello Support Team,

I'm unable to log into the Employee Portal. My 2FA code is being rejected.

My username is **j.doe**.
I generated a new code from my authenticator app and entered **123456**, but it keeps saying "Invalid Code."

Could you please assist me with this?

Thanks,

John Doe
(Employee ID: 12345)

**Sample Message 2 (More Detailed)**

**Subject:** Urgent: Cannot access Employee Portal - 2FA Failure

Dear IT Support,

I am encountering an issue when trying to log into the Employee Portal. After entering my password, I'm prompted for a two-factor authentication code, but it is consistently being rejected.

My login ID for the portal is **JDoe-001**.
I have tried multiple times in the last 10 minutes. Each time I input a new code from my Google Authenticator app (e.g., I just tried **789012**), the system returns an error stating "Incorrect 2FA Code."

I have checked that my phone's time is synchronized. This is preventing me from accessing critical work tools.

Please let me know what steps I should take or if you can reset my 2FA.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe

**Sample Message 3 (Slightly Frustrated/Informal)**

**Subject:** 2FA broken for Employee Portal

Hey Tech Support,

My 2FA isn't working for the employee portal again. This is really annoying.

I'm trying to log in as **johndoe@mycompany.com**.
I just put in the code **345678** from my SMS, and it gave me the "Verification Failed" message. I tried a few others too, like **901234**, and no luck.

What's going on? Can you help me fix this so I can log in?

Thanks,

John D.

**Key Takeaways for QA:**

*   **Username Placement:** Users might put it in the body, subject line (less common), or just assume you know it from their email address.
*   **2FA Code Placement:** Usually mentioned directly after explaining the rejection, often with an example of the specific code they tried.
*   **Error Messages:** Users will often quote the exact error they see.
*   **Context:** They might mention the type of 2FA (app, SMS, email) and steps they've already taken.
*   **Urgency:** Depending on their need for access, they might express varying levels of urgency.
