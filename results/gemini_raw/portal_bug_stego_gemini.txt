**Option 2: Slightly More Detail (Common Troubleshooting Mentioned)**

**Subject:** Urgent: 2FA Issue with Employee Portal Access

**Body:**

Dear IT Support Team,

I'm unable to log into the employee portal because my 2FA code is being rejected. I've tried generating a new code from my authenticator app (or receiving a new SMS code) multiple times, but none are working.

My username for the portal is: **[Your Username, e.g., j.doe, JDoe123]**
One of the codes I attempted was: **[The 6-digit code, e.g., 789012]**

This is preventing me from accessing my work resources. Please let me know what steps I should take or if you can reset my 2FA.

Thanks,

**Option 3: Comprehensive (Includes Context & What They've Tried)**

**Subject:** Employee Portal Login Issue: 2FA Code Not Accepted

**Body:**

Hi Team,

I'm encountering an issue logging into the company's employee portal this morning. After entering my password, the system is rejecting the two-factor authentication code I'm providing.

Here are the details:
*   **Username:** **[Your Username, e.g., j.doe, JDoe123]**
*   **Attempted 2FA Code:** **[The 6-digit code, e.g., 456789]** (This was generated from my [e.g., Google Authenticator app / via SMS / via email] at approximately [Time, e.g., 9:15 AM EST]).
*   **Portal URL:** [Optional: if there are multiple portals, e.g., portal.mycompany.com]
*   **Troubleshooting steps I've tried:**
    *   Generated several new codes from my authenticator app.
    *   Ensured my phone's time is synchronized.
    *   Tried logging in on a different browser (Chrome/Edge).

I am currently locked out and unable to access my essential work applications. Could you please look into this and advise on how to resolve the 2FA issue?
