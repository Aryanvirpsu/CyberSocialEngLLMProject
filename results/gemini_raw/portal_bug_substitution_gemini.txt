The cipher appears to be a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. Let's break it down step-by-step to find the key and decrypt the message.

**Initial Observations & High-Confidence Guesses:**

1.  **"q" as "a":** The letter "q" appears very frequently as a single-letter word. In English, "a" is the most common single-letter word.
    *   `q` → `a`

2.  **"(2GQ) jxzt":** The pattern "(number abbreviation) word" strongly suggests "2FA code" or similar. Given "2GQ", "jxzt" is very likely "code".
    *   `j` → `c`
    *   `x` → `o`
    *   `z` → `d`
    *   `t` → `e`

**Applying these initial mappings:**

Cipher: `CQ ottzy q yqbnst btyyqft q vytr ixvsz ytoz ikto ektpr tbnsxdtt nxreqs rtwtjey q eix-gqjexr qvektoepjqepxo (2GQ) jxzt. Pojsvzt nsqjty iktrt q vytr bpfke btoepxo ektpr vytroqbt aoz ekt 2GQ jxzt ektd qeetbnetz.`

Partial Decryption: `C_ o__e_y a _a_ns_ b_yy_f_ a v_er i_vs_ _to_ ik_o ek_pr _b_s_d_e n_re_s r_w_j_y a eix-g_j_x_ qvek_oepjqe_o (2Ga) code. Po_sv_e ns_j_y ik_r_ a v_er b_f_e b_o_p_o ek_pr v_er_a_t aoz ek_ 2Ga code ek_d qeetbnetz.`

**Further Deductions:**

3.  **"ektd" as "they":** In the second sentence, "aoz ekt 2GQ jxzt ektd qeetbnetz" looks like "... and the 2FA code they attempted." If `ektd` is `they`:
    *   `e` → `t`
    *   `k` → `h`
    *   `d` → `y`
    *   (`t` → `e` is consistent)

4.  **"ektpr" as "their":** Given the previous deduction, `ektpr` should be `their`.
    *   `e` → `t` (consistent)
    *   `k` → `h` (consistent)
    *   `t` → `e` (consistent)
    *   `p` → `i`
    *   `r` → `r`

5.  **"aoz" as "and":**
    *   `a` (cipher) is not `a` (plain). `aoz` becomes `a_d`. So `o` → `n`.
    *   `o` → `n`

6.  **"qeetbnetz" as "attempted":** This follows "they" and fits the length and known letters `t` and `e`.
    *   `q` → `a` (consistent)
    *   `e` → `t` (consistent)
    *   `t` → `e` (consistent)
    *   `b` → `m`
    *   `n` → `p`
    *   `z` → `d` (consistent)

7.  **"tbnsxdtt" as "employees":** This is a long word following "their" and preceding "nxreqs" (likely "portal" or "rejects").
    *   `t` → `e` (consistent)
    *   `b` → `m` (consistent)
    *   `n` → `p` (consistent)
    *   `s` → `l`
    *   `x` → `o` (consistent)
    *   `d` → `y` (consistent)
    *   (`t` → `e` is consistent)

8.  **"eix-gqjexr qvektoepjqepxo" as "two-factor authentication":** The `(2GQ)` hint earlier strongly supports this.
    *   `eix` → `two`: `e` → `t`, `i` → `w`, `x` → `o` (all consistent).
    *   `gqjexr` → `factor`: `g` → `f`, `q` → `a`, `j` → `c`, `e` → `t`, `x` → `o`, `r` → `r` (all consistent except `g` → `f`).
    *   `qvektoepjqepxo` → `authentication`: `q`→`a`, `v`→`u`, `e`→`t`, `k`→`h`, `t`→`e`, `o`→`n`, `e`→`t`, `p`→`i`, `j`→`c`, `q`→`a`, `e`→`t`, `p`→`i`, `x`→`o`, `o`→`n` (all consistent except `v` → `u`). This confirms `v` → `u`.

9.  **"ixvsz" as "would":** With `i`→`w`, `x`→`o`, `v`→`u`, `s`→`l`, `z`→`d`, `ixvsz` becomes `would`. This is a perfect fit.

10. **"iktrt" as "where":** `i`→`w`, `k`→`h`, `t`→`e`, `r`→`r`, `t`→`e`. This fits perfectly.

11. **"nsqjty" as "places":** This follows "Pojsvzt" (likely "Project"). `n`→`p`, `s`→`l`, `q`→`a`, `j`→`c`, `t`→`e`, `y`→`s`. This fits perfectly.

12. **"Pojsvzt" as "Project":** `P`→`p`, `o`→`r` (consistent with `o` earlier?), `j`→`o` (consistent with `j` earlier?), `s`→`j` (consistent with `s` earlier?), `v`→`e` (consistent with `v` earlier?), `z`→`c` (consistent with `z` earlier?), `t`→`t` (consistent with `t` earlier?).
    *   Let's reconsider `P` from the `P`o`j`svzt. `P` is for `Project`. `p`→`p`.

13. **"rtwtjey" as "rejects":** `r`→`r`, `t`→`e`, `w`→`j`, `t`→`e`, `j`→`c`, `e`→`t`, `y`→`s`. This fits perfectly. So `w` → `j`.

14. **"yqbnst" as "sample":** `y`→`s`, `q`→`a`, `b`→`m`, `n`→`p`, `s`→`l`, `t`→`e`. This fits perfectly. So `y` → `s`.

15. **"btyyqft" as "message":** `b`→`m`, `t`→`e`, `y`→`s`, `y`→`s`, `q`→`a`, `f`→`g`, `t`→`e`. This fits perfectly. So `f` → `g`.

16. **"bpfke" as "might":** `b`→`m`, `p`→`i`, `f`→`g`, `k`→`h`, `e`→`t`. This fits perfectly.

17. **"btoepxo" as "mention":** `b`→`m`, `t`→`e`, `o`→`n`, `e`→`t`, `p`→`i`, `x`→`o`, `o`→`n`. This fits perfectly.

18. **"vytroqbt" as "username":** `v`→`u`, `y`→`s`, `t`→`e`, `r`→`r`, `o`→`n`, `q`→`a`, `b`→`m`, `t`→`e`. This fits perfectly.

19. **"ottzy" as "needs":** `o`→`n`, `t`→`e`, `t`→`e`, `z`→`d`, `y`→`s`. This fits perfectly.

20. **"CQ" as "IA":** The last remaining cipher letter to map is `C`. The sentence begins "CQ needs...", which grammatically suggests "IA needs...". Thus, `C` → `I`.

**Decrypted Message:**

`IA needs a sample message a user would tend with their employees portal rejects a two-factor authentication (2FA) code. Project places where a user might mention their username and the 2FA code they attempted.`

**Translation:**

The decrypted message is: "IA needs a sample message a user would tend with their employees portal rejects a two-factor authentication (2FA) code. Project places where a user might mention their username and the 2FA code they attempted."
